# atac-seq pipeline
This repository provides a computational pipeline for processing and analysing the atac-seq data. The pipeline has mainly two parts:

1. Pre-processing part: This includes quality control checks, mapping to the reference genome, peak calling & creating [UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu) Track Hubs.  
2. Post-processing part: To identify differentially accessible regions.

Refer to user-manual for more information.
